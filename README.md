# World_Bank_Dataset

For this project, I used Jupyter to clean up the dataset on the World Bank development projects and analyzed its features. 

The source for the World Bank's dataset is http://jsonstudio.com/resources/. 

You will notice two other uploaded files in this project: 
1) "World Bank Data Analysis.ipynb" which is where I use Pandas to clean up and analyze the dataset
2) world_bank_projects.json, which is the original dataset in JSON format
